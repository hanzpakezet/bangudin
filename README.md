# MeetMe-inspired Personal Website

This is a clean, original codebase that **imitates the layout and vibe** of Colorlib's MeetMe template without copying their source.  
Colorlib templates are under **CC BY 3.0** which require attribution. We include friendly attribution in the footer.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page (one-page).
- `assets/css/style.css` — custom styles.
- `assets/js/main.js` — interactions: typewriter, filtering, smooth scroll, contact AJAX.
- `assets/php/contact.php` — simple PHP mail handler (uses `mail()`).
- `assets/img/*` — put your images here (currently using Picsum placeholders via URLs).

## How to use
1. Upload everything to your hosting.
2. Edit **contact email** in `assets/php/contact.php` (`$to = 'you@example.com'`).
3. Replace text, images, and social links in `index.html`.
4. (Optional) Add your own blog system; cards are static placeholders.
5. If you prefer attribution-free use of Colorlib templates, buy the proper license on Colorlib. For this project we only **took inspiration** and wrote fresh code.

## Local preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser. For contact form to work you need PHP on server.
